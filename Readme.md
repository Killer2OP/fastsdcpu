# FastSD CPU: A Quick and Efficient Image Generator! :rocket:

FastSD CPU is a high-speed image generation tool designed for your Core i7-12700 CPU. It creates stunning 512x512 images swiftly and efficiently, taking just 10 seconds per image (thanks to OpenVINO optimization!). This tool is based on the fantastic work done by the creators of [Latent Consistency Models](https://github.com/luosiallen/latent-consistency-model).

## OpenVINO Optimization :zap:

We'd like to extend our gratitude to [deinferno](https://github.com/deinferno) for contributing the OpenVINO model. By default, OpenVINO support is disabled, but if you're on Windows, you can enable it for blazing-fast performance. With OpenVINO, generating a single 512x512 image takes just 10 seconds on a Core i7-12700 processor.

## Supported LCM Models :paintbrush:
FastSD CPU currently supports the LCM model (Dreamshaper_v7) in Diffuser format. You can find these models at the following locations:
